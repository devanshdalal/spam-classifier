# spam-classifier
Spam classifier using Support Vector Machines 

<!-- SVMs are really accurate if used properly. but resource used are a tradeoff. -->

## The training data 

The training data is present in file _train_ and _train-small_ while unlabled data is present in file _test_

## Usage

Implementation is done using CVX package for convex-optimization which was later compared with classification done using LibSVM for matlab.<br>

Each matlab script properly documented and it explains what it is doing.

## Possible improvements
- Use capitalization data - right now we are using lowercased data. But anecdotally it seems like spams have a higher chance of being in all caps [ _shouting_ , _Supurios offers_, etc ].

- Use punctuation - the classifier doesn't really use punctuation, this is most likely a mistake because spams seem to have a lot of weird punctuation and ascii art.

- Search for keywords - just tokenizing the comment isn't the best because a lot of spam comments look like "pleasecheckoutmyfacebookpageatwwwfacebookcom/blah"

- Most of the feature which are used in twitter-sentiment-analyis can be used.
